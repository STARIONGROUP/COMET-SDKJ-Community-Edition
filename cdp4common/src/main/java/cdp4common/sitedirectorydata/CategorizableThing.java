/**
 * representation of a Thing that can be categorized to be a member of a       user-defined       Category
 * Note 1: Categorization using Categories establishes a runtime       classification       mechanism,       that       can       be       used       to       classify       architectural       elements,       parameter       types,       etc.,       and       form       the       basis       for       view       definitions,       filter       operations       and       validation       rules.
 * Note 2: Categories are (pre)defined in ReferenceDataLibraries.
 * Note 3: Assignment of a given Category to the <i>category</i> property       of       a       CategorizableThing       asserts       that       it       is       a       member       of       the       given       Category.
