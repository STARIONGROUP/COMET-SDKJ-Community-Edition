 * Note 1: A LogEntry is a human written message that records succinctly what change was applied at what point in time to the SiteDirectory or to an EngineeringModel and optionally records information on why the change was applied.
 * Note 2: A LogEntry could be categorized (see Category and CategorizableThing) e.g. to denote that a LogEntry contains a  "design rationale". This would later help with reporting or retrieving useful information from the logbook.
